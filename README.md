gcloud-pubsub-emulator
----------------------
This repository contains the Docker configuration for Google's PubSub emulator. It's mainly the dockerization and documentation of https://github.com/prep/pubsubc 

Installation
------------
A pre-built Docker container is available for Docker Hub:

```
docker run --rm -ti -p 8681:8681 valbeat/gcloud-pubsub-emulator:latest
```

Or, you can build this repository yourself:

```
docker build -t gcloud-pubsub-emulator:latest .
docker run --rm -ti -p 8681:8681 gcloud-pubsub-emulator:latest
```

Usage
-----
After you've ran the above-mentioned `docker run` command, you should be able to use any app that has PubSub implemented and point it to your Docker container by specifying the `PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable.

```
env PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8681 ./myapp
```

or

```
export PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8681
./myapp
```

### Automatic topic and subscription creation
This image also provides the ability to create topics and subscriptions in projects on startup by specifying the `PUBSUB_PROJECT` environment variable with a sequentual number appended to it, starting with _1_. The format of the environment variable is relatively simple:

```
PROJECTID,TOPIC1,TOPIC2:SUBSCRIPTION1:SUBSCRIPTION2,TOPIC3:SUBSCRIPTION3
```

A comma-separated list where the first item is the _project ID_ and the rest are topics. The topics themselves are colon-separated where the first item is the _topic ID_ and the rest are _subscription IDs_. A topic doesn't necessarily need to specify subscriptions.

For example, if you have _project ID_ `company-dev`, with topic `invoices` that has a subscription `invoice-calculator`, another topic `chats` with subscriptions `slack-out` and `irc-out` and a third topic `notifications` without any subscriptions, you'd define it this way:

```
PUBSUB_PROJECT1=company-dev,invoices:invoice-calculator,chats:slack-out:irc-out,notifications
```

So the full command would look like:

```
docker run --rm -ti -p 8681:8681 -e PUBSUB_PROJECT1=company-dev,invoices:invoice-calculator,chats:slack-out:irc-out,notifications valbeat/gcloud-pubsub-emulator:latest
```

If you want to define more projects, you'd simply add a `PUBSUB_PROJECT2`, `PUBSUB_PROJECT3`, etc.

### wait-for, wait-for-it
If you're using this Docker image in a docker-compose setup or something similar, you might have leveraged scripts like [wait-for](https://github.com/eficode/wait-for) or [wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it) to detect when the PubSub service comes up before starting a container that depends on it being up. If you're _not_ using the above-mentioned _PUBSUB_PROJECT_ environment variable, you can simply check if port `8681` is available. If you _do_ depend on one or more _PUBSUB_PROJECT_ environment variables, you should check for the availability of port `8682` as that one will become available once all the topics and subscriptions have been created.
